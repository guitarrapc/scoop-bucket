## Auto Update buckets

see https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Excavator

Follow steps to prepare auto update your bucket.

* Copy `.github` and `bin` directories of this Repository.
* Run following command on Git Bash to generate your SSH Key for auto bucket update.

```shell
# Remove existing `.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to regenerate ssh key for your repo.
rm .github/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Move to .github
cd .github
# Run gen sshkey. (This step will not run if .github/.ssh/id_rsa.pub exsits.)
# * Public key is placed in host's `.github/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
# * Private key is placed in host's `.github/.ssh/id_rsa`.
docker-compose up --build
# Encrypt private key `.github/.ssh/id_rsa.cipher` will be generated.
KEY=<YOUR_CIPHER_KEY> ./encrypt.sh
```

* Set your cipher key to github secrets, name `CIPHER_KEY`.
* Set your bucket github account info in `https://github.com/guitarrapc/scoop-bucket/blob/master/.github/docker-compose`.
