# Project Custom Instructions

## Bucket Review Guidelines

When reviewing bucket definition, focus on the following points:

- Use of Latest Scoop Features
  - Consider using the latest features of Scoop, such as reusable workflows and composite actions.
  - Follow general Scoop best practices.
    - Ensure clarity and maintainability.
    - Ensure auto-update compatibility.

Suggest fixes for any sections that deviate from these points.

## Documentation Review Guidelines

When reviewing changes to documentation, focus on the following points:

- Spelling
- Clarity and Conciseness
  - Ensure the content is written in a clear and concise manner.
- Headings
  - Check that appropriate headings are used.
- Documentation Style
  - The writing style must be consistent with existing documentation.
  - Documentation is not a personal blog post. The subject is the project itself, and the project provides content to the reader.
- Sample Code
  - Verify that the code works correctly and maintains quality.
  - Ensure the code follows general .NET coding guidelines (e.g., naming conventions).
- Language Consistency
  - Each language-specific document (e.g., README-ja.md for Japanese) must be written entirely in that language.
  - Only technical elements should remain in English: URLs, code snippets, command examples, PR/issue numbers, and technical tool names.
  - All descriptive text, instructions, and explanations must be translated to the document's target language.

If any part deviates from these points, propose a correction.
